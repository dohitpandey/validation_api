For how to use the API visit http://dohitpandey.cf/api-docs

For performing checks separate functions are defined here validation_api/validation_check/check/views.py

To add a new check feature please fork the project and add your code here -> validation_api/validation_check/check/views.py from line 69

for defining a function follow the following criteria:

  Function name has to be in this format -> inputdata_check
  
  it must accept 1 parameter which is inputdata
  
  after checking validity of the inputdata return 'Valid' or 'Invalid'
  
Confident about your logic and code ? finally make a pull request.
